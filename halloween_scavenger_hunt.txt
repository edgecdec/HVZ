Halloween Scavenger Hunt Clues (coding)

Use the datapack "scavenger" (HVZ/scavenger/data/scavenger/functions)

Note: each clue gives a tag to register that the clue has been found / keep score / allow the player to get the next one

Areas

1. Dead Square Crypt

2. Drumheller Portals

3. HUB Cottage Murder Mystery

    This part of the scavenger hunt basically follows the story of a student who went missing and was last seen at the HUB pumpkin patch.  When the players join the scavenger hunt they should be given a book that hints they should go there to find out what happened.
    This will lead to a series of clues that need to be completed in order (check for previous tag to get the next one), and each one should decrement the player's score by 1.

    Clue #3: a button leading into the basement.  The button will teleport the player to the opposite end of the basement, and give them blindess and slowness for 10 seconds.  In the middle of the basement, a SERIAL KILLER will spawn, which is optional
    to kill.  There will be a pressure plate that will open the iron door allowing the player to escape and also enable them to get the final clue

    Clue #4: a button on the gravestone behind the cottage.  When the player clicks it they should get a player head as the final clue.
